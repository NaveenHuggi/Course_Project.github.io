                <h3>1. Understanding the Supply Chain</h3>
                <p>We mapped the supply chain, involving stages from raw material sourcing to final product distribution. This process highlighted areas for improvement in procurement, manufacturing, logistics, and retail distribution. Key insights include:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Procurement:</strong> Importance of reliable suppliers and cost-effective, high-quality material sourcing.</li>
                    <li><strong>Production:</strong> Impact of production planning and capacity management on delivery times and costs.</li>
                    <li><strong>Distribution:</strong> Optimization of transportation logistics for timely delivery.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>2. Challenges in the Supply Chain</h3>
                <p>Our analysis identified several common challenges affecting supply chain efficiency:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Demand Forecasting:</strong> Difficulty predicting demand due to fluctuating market trends and changing customer preferences.</li>
                    <li><strong>Inventory Management:</strong> Balancing inventory to avoid overstocking, stockouts, or excessive storage costs.</li>
                    <li><strong>Supply Chain Visibility:</strong> Limited transparency across the supply chain hampers real-time tracking and disruption prediction.</li>
                </ul>
            </article>

            <article>
                <h3>3. Algorithms and Optimization Techniques</h3>
                <p>The integration of algorithms was crucial in optimizing supply chain operations. Key techniques employed include:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Dijkstra's Algorithm:</strong> Optimized transportation routes for minimal cost and timely delivery.</li>
                    <li><strong>Linear Programming:</strong> Balanced storage, procurement, and transportation costs for inventory optimization.</li>
                    <li><strong>Fenwick Tree:</strong> Enabled fast range queries to monitor stock levels across warehouses.</li>
                    <li><strong>Prim's Algorithm:</strong> Created minimum spanning trees for cost-efficient resource allocation.</li>
                    <li><strong>Bellman-Ford Algorithm:</strong> Recalculated optimal routes dynamically in response to supply chain disruptions.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>These algorithms were chosen for their computational efficiency and real-world applicability, significantly enhancing operational efficiency and decision-making.</p>
