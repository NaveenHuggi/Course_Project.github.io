            <h1>Introduction to Supply Chain Management</h1>
            <p>
                Supply Chain Management (SCM) is the backbone for most modern industries as it manages the smooth flow of resources, 
                information, and products across interconnected stages in an industry. 
            </p>
            <p>
                In the current project, we discuss the supply chain of the textile industry—a complex, multi-layered system. 
                Using advanced algorithms and computational techniques, we solve real-world problems such as resource allocation optimization, 
                removal of delays, and, above all, efficiency enhancement in general. 
            </p>
            <p>
                This approach not only ensures streamlined operations but contributes to sustainable practices, keeping the industry's processes 
                up to date with modern demands on the environment and the economy.
            </p>

            <h2>Problem Definition</h2>
            <p>
                There is a pressing need for an efficient supply chain management system in a smart city to ensure the timely delivery of goods, 
                reduce waste, and optimize resources. Such a system must prioritize sustainability while addressing the growing demands of urban residents. 
                A well-designed supply chain in a smart city enhances the ease of people’s collaboration, aligns with sustainable goals, and ensures 
                efficient resource utilization.
            </p>
            <p>
                Considering the city design, we selected a location near the ocean to facilitate the easy import of materials. Additionally, 
                we planned railway networks and main highways to enable seamless traffic management and transportation of goods and public. 
                These infrastructural elements form the backbone of a smart city’s supply chain system, supporting interconnectivity and efficiency.

            <h2>How the 6 Business Cases Were Identified</h2>
            <p>
                To address the complexities of the textile industry’s supply chain, we identified six critical business entities, each representing a 
                key stage in the supply chain:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Supplier:</strong> Sources raw materials such as cotton, wool, or synthetic fibers, ensuring quality and availability while minimizing costs.</li>
                <li><strong>Manufacturer:</strong> Converts raw materials into finished goods through processes like spinning, dyeing, and weaving, requiring efficient scheduling and resource allocation.</li>
                <li><strong>Distributor:</strong> Acts as a logistical bridge, transporting finished products from manufacturers to wholesalers, ensuring timely and cost-effective delivery.</li>
                <li><strong>Wholesaler:</strong> Manages bulk inventory, bridging the gap between distributors and retailers by ensuring steady supply and demand management.</li>
                <li><strong>Retailer:</strong> Directly interfaces with customers, providing products in line with market demand and customer preferences.</li>
                <li><strong>Customer:</strong> The ultimate consumer whose satisfaction drives the entire supply chain, influencing its efficiency and responsiveness.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                These entities are interconnected, forming a cohesive system where efficiency at each level determines the overall success of the supply chain. 
                The algorithms used in this project optimize these interdependencies, focusing on reducing delays, cutting costs, and enhancing sustainability.
            </p>

            <h2>Why It Is Necessary for a Smart City Project</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Sustainability:</strong> Optimized supply chains reduce waste and carbon footprints, aligning with eco-friendly initiatives.</li>
                <li><strong>Smart Logistics:</strong> Advanced algorithms enable real-time tracking, route optimization, and faster delivery, crucial for urban living.</li>
                <li><strong>Cost Efficiency:</strong> By reducing delays and inventory mismanagement, SCM enhances the economic viability of smart city operations.</li>
                <li><strong>Consumer-Centric Approach:</strong> Smart cities prioritize citizens' needs, and a robust SCM ensures the availability of goods and services at the right time and place.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                This project aligns with the goals of smart cities and shows how technology and algorithms can transform the processes of supply chains 
                to meet future urban challenges.
