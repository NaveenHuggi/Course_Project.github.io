            <h1>Introduction to Supply Chain Management</h1>
            <p>
                Supply Chain Management acts as the backbone of most modern industries in the resource flow, information flow, and product flow across diverse interdependent stages. 
                Through this, SCM is significant in giving the opportunity for businesses to meet demand on the market efficiently as well as sustainably.
            </p>
            <p>
                As such, the supply chain facing issues for the textile industry had been identified within the need of a smart city framework. 
                An in-depth study concluded that there are wasteful practices in traditional chains along with delay, without considering sustainable practices. 
                While tackling these issues and the concepts incorporated within the modern city framework, several substantial scopes for optimization came forth.
            </p>
            <p>
                This design of the system aimed at matching the smart city vision, utilizing the transportation network with efficient use of rails and highways 
                in facilitating movement and reducing congestion caused by traffic. We ensure proximity to key routes in import and export costs on material imports. 
                Furthermore, we witnessed the clean environment that vehicle-free zones and walkable streets enhance with regard to efficient resources flow and people's movements.
            </p>
            <p>
                The project also identified six key business entities: supplier, manufacturer, distributor, wholesaler, retailer, and customer, 
                which are the critical stages in the textile supply chain. These entities form an interconnected network, and their effective functioning 
                is crucial to the system's overall success. Algorithms and computational models have been used to address the challenges 
                at each stage to improve efficiency, sustainability, and reliability.
            </p>
            <p>
                This initiative proposes a comprehensive and forward-thinking supply chain model aligned with the principles of smart city development and 
                paving the way for sustainable, efficient systems.

            <h2>Problem Definition</h2>
            <p>
                There is a pressing need for an efficient supply chain management system in a smart city to ensure the timely delivery of goods, 
                reduce waste, and optimize resources. Such a system must prioritize sustainability while addressing the growing demands of urban residents. 
                A well-designed supply chain in a smart city enhances the ease of people’s collaboration, aligns with sustainable goals, and ensures 
                efficient resource utilization.
            </p>
            <p>
                Considering the city design, we selected a location near the ocean to facilitate the easy import of materials. Additionally, 
                we planned railway networks and main highways to enable seamless traffic management and transportation of goods and public. 
                These infrastructural elements form the backbone of a smart city’s supply chain system, supporting interconnectivity and efficiency.

            <h2>Insights from the "Streets White Sheet"</h2>
            <p>
                The "streets white sheets" provided valuable data about Matheran’s infrastructure and logistics model. Key takeaways include:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <strong>Vehicle-Free Zones:</strong> Matheran’s approach to prohibiting motorized vehicles has significantly improved air quality and reduced noise pollution. 
                    This concept can be adapted for smart city planning by designating specific areas as vehicle-free zones, promoting eco-friendly alternatives such as 
                    electric vehicles, bicycles, and pedestrian pathways.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Efficient Transportation:</strong> The reliance on railways and horse carriages demonstrates how alternative transportation methods can reduce 
                    congestion and enhance the movement of goods. In a smart city, this can translate to modern rail systems and sustainable last-mile delivery options.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Cost Optimization:</strong> Insights into the pricing structure of accommodations and transportation in Matheran highlight the importance of 
                    affordability and accessibility. Smart cities can incorporate tiered pricing models to cater to diverse socio-economic groups while ensuring profitability.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Tourism and Local Economy:</strong> The tourism-driven economy of Matheran underscores the role of supply chains in supporting local businesses. 
                    Smart cities can adopt similar models by integrating local markets into their supply chain networks, fostering economic growth and cultural preservation.

            <h2>How the 6 Business Cases Were Identified</h2>
            <p>
                To address the complexities of the textile industry’s supply chain, we identified six critical business entities, each representing a 
                key stage in the supply chain:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Supplier:</strong> Sources raw materials such as cotton, wool, or synthetic fibers, ensuring quality and availability while minimizing costs.</li>
                <li><strong>Manufacturer:</strong> Converts raw materials into finished goods through processes like spinning, dyeing, and weaving, requiring efficient scheduling and resource allocation.</li>
                <li><strong>Distributor:</strong> Acts as a logistical bridge, transporting finished products from manufacturers to wholesalers, ensuring timely and cost-effective delivery.</li>
                <li><strong>Wholesaler:</strong> Manages bulk inventory, bridging the gap between distributors and retailers by ensuring steady supply and demand management.</li>
                <li><strong>Retailer:</strong> Directly interfaces with customers, providing products in line with market demand and customer preferences.</li>
                <li><strong>Customer:</strong> The ultimate consumer whose satisfaction drives the entire supply chain, influencing its efficiency and responsiveness.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                These entities are interconnected, forming a cohesive system where efficiency at each level determines the overall success of the supply chain. 
                The algorithms used in this project optimize these interdependencies, focusing on reducing delays, cutting costs, and enhancing sustainability.
