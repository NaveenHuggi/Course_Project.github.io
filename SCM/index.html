            <h1>Introduction to Supply Chain Management</h1>
            <p>
                Supply Chain Management (SCM) is the backbone for most modern industries as it manages the smooth flow of resources, 
                information, and products across interconnected stages in an industry. 
            </p>
            <p>
                In the current project, we discuss the supply chain of the textile industryâ€”a complex, multi-layered system. 
                Using advanced algorithms and computational techniques, we solve real-world problems such as resource allocation optimization, 
                removal of delays, and, above all, efficiency enhancement in general. 
            </p>
            <p>
                This approach not only ensures streamlined operations but contributes to sustainable practices, keeping the industry's processes 
                up to date with modern demands on the environment and the economy.
            </p>

            <h2>How It Works (Using 6 Business Cases)</h2>
            <p>There are six interdependent business entities in a supply chain:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Supplier:</strong> Sources raw materials such as cotton or synthetic fibers, ensuring good quality and availability.</li>
                <li><strong>Manufacturer:</strong> Converts raw material into finished goods through processes such as spinning, dyeing, and weaving.</li>
                <li><strong>Distributor:</strong> Acts as a bridge, transporting products from manufacturers to wholesalers efficiently.</li>
                <li><strong>Wholesaler:</strong> Manages bulk inventory and ensures availability for retailers.</li>
                <li><strong>Retailer:</strong> Directly interacts with consumers, providing products based on market demand.</li>
                <li><strong>Consumer:</strong> The end-user whose satisfaction and feedback influence the entire chain.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                These entities are interdependent, and any disruption at one level affects the whole system. 
                Algorithms such as predictive analytics, optimization techniques, and logistics models are applied to address challenges like 
                inventory management, demand forecasting, and waste reduction.
            </p>

            <h2>Why It Is Necessary for a Smart City Project</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Sustainability:</strong> Optimized supply chains reduce waste and carbon footprints, aligning with eco-friendly initiatives.</li>
                <li><strong>Smart Logistics:</strong> Advanced algorithms enable real-time tracking, route optimization, and faster delivery, crucial for urban living.</li>
                <li><strong>Cost Efficiency:</strong> By reducing delays and inventory mismanagement, SCM enhances the economic viability of smart city operations.</li>
                <li><strong>Consumer-Centric Approach:</strong> Smart cities prioritize citizens' needs, and a robust SCM ensures the availability of goods and services at the right time and place.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                This project aligns with the goals of smart cities and shows how technology and algorithms can transform the processes of supply chains 
                to meet future urban challenges.
